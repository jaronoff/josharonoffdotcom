<h1>About Josh</h1>
<p>I have been in the business of “creating” since I was a little kid. In the 6th grade, I won 2nd place in a county-wide health poster contest. I created a comic book character called The Veggenator (imagine a carrot with muscular arms and legs, sunglasses and a gun who teaches kids to eat fruits and vegetables instead of candy.) Naturally, I won a fruit basket. And that was the first time I realized I could create things and get paid for it! </p>

<p>In High School I took art classes, learned to paint and sketch, and was also involved in Theater. Theater helped me to understand what worked (and didn’t work) in my approach to people. It was an outlet to be creative while using my body and voice as tools instead of a paintbrush or pencil. </p>

<p>My freshman year of college, I wanted to be a writer and make my living writing science fiction. I was in for a rude awakening when I realized how tough it actually IS to write a book! After deciding I would not be the next Asimov or Philip K. Dick, I settled on being a Journalism major. I wrote a couple articles that never saw the light of day, and realized that this type of writing gets most attention when discussing what’s bad about people instead of what’s good. I think my professor said it best when he said, “The three things that sell the most are money, sex and death.”</p>

<p>So, I tried my hand at Graphic Design. And with that, I really found my calling. I currently live in Pittsburgh, PA with my wife Kate, daughter Lucia and our cat Ridley. I’m a Web Designer for <%= link_to "RadNet", "http://www.radnet.com" %>. I’m a certified PADI Rescue Diver and eventually would like to go for more training to become a master diver. I am currently accepting clients so if you would like to work together on a project please contact me.</p>
